## User Story
- As a cafe owner, Id to post my instagram photos of my cafe and the fancy drinks to bring more regulars into my place.
### Problem
- There is a lot of competition in this market and I don't have the extra money for paid advertising. I had just opened this cafe in a less busy part of town and business was good for the first opening but slowly tapered off. My social media is growing slowly but data suggests my website is getting more traffic than my socials. By showing the warm vibes of the cafe and the neat drinks on my website, I believe I would get more regulars through my doors.
- Pulling instagram posts would show that post twice (more if used in more than one endpoint) when only posting on instagram. People would pay for this service because it's less work on the posters end while still maintaining the reach to the desired audience.
